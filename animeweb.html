        <P>Tony Tony Chopper is a doctor and a blue-nosed reindeer. The power of the Zoan-type Human-Human Fruit
          provides him with the ability to transform into a full-sized reindeer or a reindeer-human hybrid.[ch. 140] A
          self-developed drug he calls Rumble ball enables him to perform even more transformations for three minutes.
          With help from Caesar Clown, Chopper can last in his transformations for about 30 minutes.<br>

          width="180">
        <p>Jimbei is a yakuza-esque whale shark-type fish-man. A master of Fish-Man Karate, he is capable of
          manipulating water as if it were a tangible cloth. Jimbei can communicate with fish, an ability more usually
          associated with merfolk, and enlist the help of whale sharks.After growing up in a rough part of Fish-Man
          Island, Jimbei first joins the island's royal army and later the Sun Pirates; he becomes captain following the
          death of Fisher Tiger.In exchange for the World Government granting him Warlord-status and amnesty to the Sun
          Pirates, Jimbei eventually disbands the crew. He resigns the position to side against the Government during
          its war with the Whitebeard Pirates, the protectors of Fish-Man Island. Two years later, he enlists the help
          of the Straw Hat Pirates to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'état against Fish-Man Island's royal
          family. Jimbei then turns down an invitation from Luffy to join his crew, having already aligned with the Big
          Mom Pirates after the death of Whitebeard.[ch. 649] After cutting ties with Big Mom, he joins the Straw Hat
          Pirates as the crew's helmsman.

          In the Japanese anime television series, Jimbei is initially voiced by Daisuke Gōri, later by Katsuhisa Hōki.
          In the Funimation English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Daniel Baugh.</p>
